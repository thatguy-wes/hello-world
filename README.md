# hello-world

Here it is, the start of my journey.
A programming journey, though it will meander and wind --
    see rises and falls, 
    slowed by molehills and potholes,
    met with sheer climbs and doubtfully-footed cliffs --
that should nonetheless be rewarding.
I earnestly await the /adventure/ I hope it to be.
I hopefully pursue the freedoms it will unlock.
